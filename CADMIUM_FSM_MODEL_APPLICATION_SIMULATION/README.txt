/****STEPS FOR COMPILATION AND EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAMS****/
/***********************************************************/

0 - OfflineFileTransferSimulation.doc contains the explanation of this model

1 - Update include path in the makefile in this folder and subfolders. following lines need to be updated:
	INCLUDECADMIUM=-I ../../cadmium/include
	INCLUDEDESTIMES=-I ../../DESTimes/include
    	Update the relative path to cadmium/include from the folder where the makefile is. You need to take into account where you copied the folder during the installation process
	Example: INCLUDECADMIUM=-I ../../cadmium/include
	Do the same for the DESTimes library
   
2 - Compile the project and the tests
	2.1 - Open the terminal (Ubuntu terminal for Linux) in the CADMIUM_FSM_MODEL_APPLICATION_SIMULATION folder
	2.2 - To compile the project, run the Simulation and the tests, type in the terminal:
	      2.1 - make clean
	      2.2 - make all
	      2.3 - cd scripts
	      2.4 - chmod 777 script.sh
	      2.5 - ./script.sh
		
3 - To check the output of the tests and simulations, go to the folder simulation_results and open the output files for all the test cases run. For example, for Elevator Application, 		"ElevatorMsg.txt" and "ElevatorStates.txt" would be generated. These files need to be renamed if results are required to persist because they will be overwritten on every subsequent test run.
